# Network test and validation with pyATS - Crawl / Walk / Run

Network testing and validation tools is a massively growing area within network and infrastructure engineering, engineers and architects are looking for tools that answer questions 

- What has changed on the network config?
- Is my dataplane operating the way that I would expect?
- Can I compare my control plane and dataplane against a known good baseline?
- Can I automate this process across my entire estate

Originally developed for internal Cisco engineering use, pyATS / Genie is at the core of Cisco's Test Automation Solution. Some interesting numbers on pyATS current use within Cisco:

- Used by 3000+ internal Cisco developers
- Over 2,000,000 test runs on a monthly basis
